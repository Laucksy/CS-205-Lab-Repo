-- Comments ------------------

- Unittests are minimal.

- Comments are OK, but it is hard to identify them because there is not enough
  whitespace provided. Also there are several large chunks of code that is not
  well organized.

- All Robot tests pass, but worm tests do not. However, many robot tests are
  commented out. Also the number for worm tests seem very light.
