-- Comments ------------------

- Worm looses a section when it first moves.

- Robot appears to work.

- No unit-tests for the Engine parent class.

- No real comments in Engine class.

- The game board needs to be deleted in the reverse order it is created. You
  just delete game board, which will cause a memory leak.

- The endwin method should be in the destructor of the screen class.
